# Welcome
Welcome to the Late Nights online textbook ðŸŽ‰

This textbook will walk you through programming practices, program design, object-oriented programming, data structures, and more!

This textbook will focus on helping you write better code by focusing on the process of writing code and practices you can follow to ensure you write high-quality software.
Developing software is more than simply writing code.
It is a process.
We will not cover all aspects of developing software here but will introduce some fundamental principles and practices involved in developing high-quality software.

Ultimately, our goal is to develop software that works well and that is easy to maintain.
We have to remember that software is written for two different audiences - both computers and humans have to understand and use the software you write.



## Code Blocks
Throughout the textbook there will be several runnable and editable code examples.
You can click the play button in the bottom left to run the code block and the reset button in the bottom right to undo any changes you've made.

<CodeBlock title="Code Block Example"
code={`
def foo():
    print('Go Ahead')
    bar()
${''}
def bar():
    print('Try editing this window!')
${''}
foo()
`}/>

You can play around with these editing the code and running them to see what happens.
But, be warned, your changes will be reset if you reload the page.



## What's with the Cows?
They are there to add some spice to my, and hopefully, your life.
Error messages are never fun.
But, the addition of cows might make getting error messages just a bit less draining.

<CodeBlock
title={'Moo'}
code={`
raise Cowsay('Moo')
'''  \\   ^__^
      \\  (oo)\\_______
         (__)\\       )\\/\\
             ||----w |
             ||     ||
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
`}/>
