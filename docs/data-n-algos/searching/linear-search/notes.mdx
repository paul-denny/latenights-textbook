# Additional Notes
In the [searching for the last index](algorithm.mdx#searching-for-the-last-index) section, a common linear search anti-pattern was identified where a `last_found` variable was used to keep track of the last occurrence of an item.
For sequences like lists, strings, and tuples, this can be slightly inefficient as it guarantees worst case complexity.
In general, the `range` function should be reversed to search for the last occurrence of an item.

However, for _some_ data structures that only go "in one direction" like singularly linked lists, reversing the `range` function (or using the `range` function at all) would actually give us $$O(n^2)$$ time complexity!
This is because indexing values in some data structures such as linked lists is an expensive $$O(n)$$ time operation.
In this case, it is actually better to loop forwards with a `last_found` variable by using an _iterator_ to loop over values rather than a `range`.
For example:

<CodeBlock title={'Finding the Last Index - In a Linked List'}
preamble={`
from collections.abc import Sequence;
from collections import deque
from typing import Any
class MyLinkedList(deque): ...`}
code={`
def linear_search(data: Sequence, target: Any) -> bool:
    last_found = -1
    for i, elt in enumerate(data):
        if elt == target:
            last_found = i
    return last_found
${''}
${''}
data_list = MyLinkedList(['some', 'words', 'in', 'a', 'list'])
print(linear_search(data_list, 'in'))
print(linear_search(data_list, 'Hello'))
`}/>

If the iterator for this linked list was implemented efficiently, this will have an $$O(n)$$ time complexity for the average, best, and worst cases.
