# Implementation
There are lots of ways to implement a linear search that can be used to do slightly different things.
This chapter is not exhaustive but will give an overview of some different ways linear search could be implemented and the different types of things linear search could search for.



## Searching by Value
Let's say we want to check whether an iterable contains a particular item.
The following function, `linear_search`, checks for the existence of the `target` parameter inside the `data` iterable.

<CodeBlock title={'Linear Search - Search for Existence'}
           preamble={'from collections.abc import Iterable; from typing import Any'}
           code={`
def linear_search(data: Iterable, target: Any) -> bool:
    for elt in data:
        if elt == target:
            return True
    return False
${''}
${''}
data_list = ['some', 'words', 'in', 'a', 'list']
print(linear_search(data_list, 'in'))
print(linear_search(data_list, 'Hello'))
`}/>



### Seems Familiar? The `in` Keyword
Python already _has_ a way to check for the existence of a value in any type of container, including sequences and iterables, using the `in` keyword.
The following is equivalent to the code block above:

<CodeBlock title={'Search for Existence - Using the in Keyword'}
           code={`
data_list = ['some', 'words', 'in', 'a', 'list']
${''}
print('in' in data_list)
print('Hello' in data_list)
`}/>

In most cases, the `in` keyword is the preferred way of checking for the existence of a value in a container.
And, for linear data types such as lists, tuples, and strings, Python will use linear search "in the background" to check for the existence of the item.



## Searching by Condition
Sometimes it may be preferable to check whether an item matching some condition exists within in an iterable.
For example, let's say we want to check whether a list of strings contains a word that is less than three characters long:

<CodeBlock title={'Searching by Condition - Hardcoded Predicate'}
           preamble={'from collections.abc import Iterable'}
           code={`
def contains_small(words: Iterable[str]) -> bool:
    for word in words:
        if len(word) < 3:
            return True
    return False
${''}
${''}
data_list = ['some', 'words', 'in', 'a', 'list']
print(contains_small(data_list))
`}/>

In this case, the function `contains_small` has a hardcoded condition to check each value against.



### Seems Familiar? The `any` function
Just like with checking by value, Python already has an inbuilt feature for checking if a value matching some condition exists.
We can use the `any` function to check for the existence of a value matching some condition by combining it with a generator expression:

<CodeBlock title={'Searching by Condition - Using the any Function'}
           code={`
data_list = ['some', 'words', 'in', 'a', 'list']
${''}
print(any(len(word) < 3 for word in data_list))
`}/>

While the `any` function is convenient for **simple** cases, if the condition being checked becomes complex, then using a for loop and if statement, like in the previous examples, may be more readable.


## Searching for an Index
When dealing with sequences where we can refer to items by index, oftentimes we not only want to know _if_ a particular item is in a sequence, but also _where_ that item might be in the sequence.
In this case, we can adapt our linear search algorithm to return the index of the first occurrence of a value in a sequence.
For example:

<CodeBlock title={'Linear Search - Finding the First Index'}
           preamble={'from collections.abc import Sequence; from typing import Any'}
           code={`
def linear_search(data: Sequence, target: Any) -> int:
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data[i] == target:
            return i
    raise ValueError(f'{target!r} is not in the Sequence')
${''}
${''}
data_list = ['sometimes', 'words', 'in', 'a', 'list', 'sometimes', 'repeat']
print(linear_search(data_list, 'sometimes'))
print(linear_search(data_list, 'Hello'))
`}/>

In this case, if the given `target` is not found in the sequence, a `ValueError` is raised.
However, it is common to return a value like -1 if the target cannot be found in the sequence to avoid raising an error.



### Seems Familiar? The `.index` Method
Sequences in Python already have a method to find the index of a particular item â€“ the `.index` method.
The following is equivalent to the example above:

<CodeBlock title={'Finding the First Index - The .index Method'}
           code={`
data_list = ['sometimes', 'words', 'in', 'a', 'list', 'sometimes', 'repeat']
${''}
print(data_list.index('sometimes'))
print(data_list.index('Hello'))
`}/>

If a value is not in the sequence, a `ValueError` is raised.

:::info Strings and `.find`

Strings also have an additional `.find` method.
This works in the same way as the `.index` method except if a value is not in the string, $$-1$$ is returned instead of an error being raised.

<CodeBlock title={'Using .find on Strings'}
           code={`
data = 'sometimes words in a string sometimes repeat'
${''}
print(data.find('sometimes'))
print(data.find('Hello'))
`}/>

:::



### Searching for the Last Index
Occasionally, we want to find the _last_ occurrence of an item.
In this case, we simply need to reverse the `range` in the for loop from before:

<CodeBlock title={'Linear Search - Finding the Last Index'}
           preamble={'from collections.abc import Sequence; from typing import Any'}
           code={`
def linear_search(data: Sequence, target: Any) -> int:
    for i in range(len(data) - 1, -1, -1):
        if data[i] == target:
            return i
    raise ValueError(f'{target!r} is not in the Sequence')
${''}
${''}
data_list = ['sometimes', 'words', 'in', 'a', 'list', 'sometimes', 'repeat']
print(linear_search(data_list, 'sometimes'))
print(linear_search(data_list, 'Hello'))
`}/>

This way we start searching from the end of the list and stop when we hit the first rightmost index of the target.
I.e., the last index of the target.

:::warning Anti-Pattern Alert!

A lot of programmers' knee-jerk reaction to finding the last occurrence of an item is to use some kind of `current` variable that updates when a new occurrence of the target has been found:

<CodeBlock title={'Anti-Pattern - Finding the Last Index'}
           preamble={'from collections.abc import Sequence; from typing import Any'}
           code={`
def linear_search(data: Sequence, target: Any) -> int:
    last_found = -1
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data[i] == target:
            last_found = i
    return last_found
${''}
${''}
data_list = ['sometimes', 'words', 'in', 'a', 'list', 'sometimes', 'repeat']
print(linear_search(data_list, 'sometimes'))
`}/>

While this works, it guarantees worst-case complexity and adds unnecessary variables to the solution.
It is easier to just reverse the `range` rather than take an entirely different approach.

:::

Unfortunately, there is no commonly accepted function or method to find the last index of an item in a sequence in Python.
Perhaps the easiest would be to use the `indexOf` function from the `operator` module with the reversed sequence:

<CodeBlock title={'Finding the Last Index - The indexOf Function'}
           code={`
from operator import indexOf
${''}
data_list = ['sometimes', 'words', 'in', 'a', 'list', 'sometimes', 'repeat']
print(len(data_list) - indexOf(reversed(data_list), 'sometimes') - 1)
`}/>

However, this isn't exactly readable, so in this case a simple for loop might be the best option.

:::info Strings and `.rfind` and `.rindex`

While sequences in general don't have an easy method for finding the last index of an item, strings have two methods `.rfind` and `.rindex` that do just that.
These methods work in the same way as `.find` and `.index`, but search from the right side of the string.

<CodeBlock title={'Using .rfind and .rindex on Strings'}
           code={`
data = 'sometimes words in a list sometimes repeat'
${''}
print(data.rfind('sometimes'))
print(data.rindex('sometimes'))
${''}
print(data.rfind('Hello'))
print(data.rindex('Hello'))
`}/>

### Searching for an Index by Condition
Another variation of linear search is that we may want to search for an index by some condition.
In this case, we could just repurpose the for loop from the [searching by condition](#searching-by-condition) section above to return the index of the element instead of `True` or `False`.

However, we would also use the `next` function combined with a generator expression to find an index based on a condition:

<CodeBlock title={'Searching for an Index by Condition - The next Function'}
           code={`
data_list = ['sometimes', 'words', 'in', 'a', 'list', 'sometimes', 'repeat']
${''}
index = next(i for i, elt in enumerate(data_list) if len(elt) < 3)
print(index)
`}/>

As with the `any` function, this is fine for **simple** cases but if the condition becomes complex, a for loop would be best.

Also, the `next` function will raise a `StopIteration` exception if no values matching the condition exist.
To instead return some kind of default value, use the optional default parameter:
<p style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
    <code>index = next(i for i, elt in enumerate(data_list) if len(elt) &lt; 3, -1)</code>
</p>
In this case, the default value is -1 and will be returned if no strings shorter than three characters long are in the data list.


## Using a While Loop
For some linear data structures, it might be easier to loop over items using a while loop.
To convert the basic linear search for loop to a while loop, we can do the following:

<CodeBlock title={'Linear Search - Using a While Loop'}
           preamble={'from collections.abc import Sequence; from typing import Any'}
           code={`
def linear_search(data: Sequence, target: Any) -> bool:
    i = 0
    while i < len(data) and data[i] != target:
        i += 1
    return i != len(data)
${''}
${''}
data_list = ['some', 'words', 'in', 'a', 'list']
print(linear_search(data_list, 'in'))
print(linear_search(data_list, 'Hello'))
`}/>

Here, if the item is in the sequence, the index `i` will be less than the length of the sequence after the while loop, so the function returns True.
However, if the item is not in the sequence, the loop exists when `i` is equal to the length of the sequence, so the function returns False.
