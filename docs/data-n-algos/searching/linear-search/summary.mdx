# Summary
**Linear Search:**
- Is a simple algorithm to implement to search for the existence or location of items in linear data types.
- Can search for values in nominal (i.e. unsortable) and unsorted data without any preprocessing.
- Has an average and worst case time complexity of $$O(n)$$ but a best case time complexity of $$O(1)$$.
- However, the overall performance of linear search depends on the distribution of data and expected target values.
- Already has many common built-in implementations in Python such as `.index`, and `in` for sequences such as lists, and tuples; and additionally `.find`, `.rindex`, and `.rfind` for strings.

## How to do it
There are several ways to "do" linear search with many of them being built-in to Python.
Here are some of the ways you could search for values:

**Check if an item is in a collection using the `in` operator:**
<CodeBlock title="Check if an item is in a Collection"
code={`
data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
${''}
print(3 in data)
print(10 in data)
`}/>

**Get the index of an item in a Sequence using the `.index` method:**
<CodeBlock title="Get the index of an item in a sequence"
           code={`
data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
${''}
print(data.index(3))
print(data.index(10))
`}/>

**Note:** This raises a `ValueError` if the item is not in the Sequence.
Use `.find` on strings to return -1 instead of raising an error.

**Check if an item matching some condition is in a Sequence or iterable using the `any` function:**
<CodeBlock title="Check for the existence of an item on some condition"
code={`
data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
${''}
print(any(x % 2 == 0 for x in data))  # contains an even value
print(any(x > 10 for x in data))  # contains a value greater than 10
`}/>

**Get the index of an item matching some condition using the `next` function:**
<CodeBlock title="Get the index of an item matching a condition"
code={`
data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
${''}
print(next(i for i, x in enumerate(data) if x % 2 == 0))
print(next(i for i, x in enumerate(data) if x > 10))
`}/>

**Note:** `next` will raise a `StopIteration` error if no item matching the condition exists.
You can use a default value to avoid this: `next(i for i, x in enumerate(data) if x > 10, -1)` where -1 is the default value that will be returned if no values are greater than 10 in `data`.

### Most Importantly
If the conditions you need to check for are complex, it is just best to use a loop:
<CodeBlock title="Using a loop to search"
code={`
def first_even(data):
    for i, value in enumerate(data):
        if value % 2 == 0:
            return i
    raise ValueError('There are no even values in the Sequence')
${''}
data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(first_even(data))
`}/>
